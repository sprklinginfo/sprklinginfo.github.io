					<aside class="notes">Alright everyone, First thing first, I want to start by thank you all for giving me the opportunity to demonstrate my skills and experience that I can bring into the position. The topic for today’s presentation is “Striving for a premier learning environment at Sheridan - A Work Plan as a Metadata & Systems Librarian”. My name is Lingling Jiang. Just to refresh your memory about me a little bit.</aside>

					<h2>Agenda</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Here is an overview of the whole presentation: First, we start by a simple framework I used to help me identify 4 core work objectives to the metadata and systems librarian. To address those objectives, 5 work actions are proposed to form the work plan. Finally I would like to invite you to join me for a showcase of a couple of projects I am really proud of.</aside>
					<ul>
						<li>1 Simple Framework</li>
						<li>4 Core Work Objectives</li>
						<li>5 Work Actions</li>
						<li>Projects showcase</li>
					</ul>

				<section> 
					<h1>The Framework</h1>
					<ol class="sortable" style="cursor: pointer;">
						<li>Where are we now?</li>
						<li>Where are we going?</li>
						<li>How will we get there?</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="float: right;"><small>(Olsen, 2012)</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">To research and prepare for this presentation, I used a basic strategic planning framework to help myself set up the work objectives and think about what I should do to align with library strategic goals. The framework is to ask three simple questions: First, where are we now? Secondly, Where are we going? Finally How to get there?. Since we already have strategic goals established, I need flip the order of the first two questions to in my case.</aside>
					
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Where are we going?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">First, I want to understand “Where are we going?” by analyzing the strategic goals and the responsibilities listed from the job posting. </aside>
					<section>
						<h3>Strategic Goals & Responsibilities Analysis</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div id="image-viewer-11" class="cf">
							<img src="images/goals-md.png" data-high-res-src="images/goals.svg" alt="" class="gallery-items">
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">So those are strategic goals outlined to be important to this position. and major responsibilities are expected to perform by metadata & systems librarian. Let’s see how those responsibilities help to meet those goals.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div id="image-viewer-12" class="cf">
							<img src="images/responsibilities-md.png" data-high-res-src="images/responsibilities.svg" alt="" class="gallery-items">

						<div id="image-viewer-13" class="cf">
							<img src="images/responsibilities-goals-md.png" data-high-res-src="images/responsibilities-goals.svg" alt="" class="gallery-items">
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">From this diagram it is clear that each responsibility is designed to support one or more goals. All those goals are critical to the success of the library, but some goals seems more demanding, like goal 2.1 “Utilize digital tools to provide better access to collections and services” is the centerpiece as most responsibilities supports it more or less , followed by some other goals, like goal 2.3, 1.3 and 2.2.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Findings -- 4 Core Work Objectives</h3>
						<aside class="notes">Based on this analysis, my work objectives in high level will be… and I use them as guidance to decide what actions I should take.</aside>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment highlight-red">Objective 2.1 - Utilize digital tools to provide better access to collections and services</li>
							<li class="fragment">Objective 2.3 - Implement mobile-friendly solutions</li>
							<li class="fragment">Objective 1.3 - Enhance access to external collections</li>
							<li class="fragment">Objective 2.2 - Embed Library content and services into the Learning Management System (LMS)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section> <!-- slide -->
					<h2>Where am I now?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Knowing how the position is linked to the big picture is helpful and useful. But I also want to know “Where am I now?”. Am I ready for this position? Let’s find out by looking at my skills and knowledge I have built up from years in IT field and library environment. I called them my core competencies.</aside>
					<section>
						<h3>Core competencies & Responsibilities Analysis</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div id="image-viewer-21" class="cf">
							<img src="images/skills-md.png" data-high-res-src="images/skills.svg" alt="" class="gallery-items">

						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Findings -- Confidence and Challenge</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">All of core skills and knowledge can be applied to support one or more responsibilities of the position</li>
							<li class="fragment">I should enhance knowledge & skills on mobile web & mobile app development</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">Based on the analysis, I am very confident I am a good fit for this position as all of core skills and knowledge can be applied to support one or more responsibilities of the position. That is great. But I also realized I need enhance and advance knowledge and skills on mobile development area so I can make greater contribution to one of core work objectives.</aside>
					</section>

					<h2>Where are we Now?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">With those analysis, I successfully identified the most important objectives to the position. Now I need find out “Where are we now?”. More analysis should be done in order to identify existing gaps and explore ways to fill them. One of techniques is SWOT analysis. SWOT means …</aside>
					<section>
						<h3>SWOT analysis</h3>
						<p>Identify <span style="color:#CC4B16;">S</span>trengths, <span style="color:#CC4B16;">W</span>eaknesses, <span style="color:#CC4B16;">O</span>pportunities and <span style="color:#CC4B16;">T</span>hreats</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Action 1 -- Library Systems/Services Assessment</h3>
						<aside class="notes">Naturally I consider my first work action is “Library Systems/Services Assessment”. It supports all objectives. I see this as a long-time, multi-dimensional, ongoing and iterative process. Starts by gathering data or reports produced by library team, IT or other units on campus for library website, ILS, Discovery layer, Institutional Repository and other technologies currently being used. Most likely we need conduct some new assessments if no data or reports available in some areas. The assessments that I am interested include User Research to understand user behaviors, needs and motivations and Service quality assessment. (Data collection and analysis methods/User Research: Card Sorting, interviews, focus group, persona, survey, usability testing, task analysis and user cases, google analytics etc., Service quality assessment like LibQUAL etc.)</aside>
						<p>Supports: All objectives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A long-time, multi-dimensional, ongoing and iterative process</li>
							<li>Gathering data (Reports and data by Library team, IT & other units on campus)</li>
							<li>Library systems (Website, ILS, Discovery, IR & other technologies)</li>
							<li>User Research to understand user behaviors, needs and motivations</li>
							<li>Service quality assessment</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section> <!-- slide -->
					<h2>How will we get there?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">OK it is time to think about how we get there? Frankly speaking, it also depends on what I will get from Library Systems/Services Assessment. Now I will try to outline several ideas that could potentially be on my real work plan to support one or more Work Objectives.</aside>
					<section>
						<aside class="notes">Start by enhancing web scale discovery. It supports Objective 2.1, 1.3 and 2.3. It is a journey to find answers to a series of questions. Are all our IR records or local collections included in Summon? If not, add to catalog or harvest them. Are search results relevant? Too many search results? what to show and what to suppress will be a tough decision. Do we need pick and include related Open Access content to our discovery? like content in Digital Commons, so users can find those content without leaving our site. Summon has Automated Contextual Research Assistance feature, so we can include localized recommendations, research guides, and live reference help to improve UX. Finally do we need social networking tools, things like reviews, rating and sharing reading list? Those are common features available in LibraryThing or BiblioCommons.</aside>
						<h3>Action 2 -- Enhance Web Scale Discovery</h3>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1, 1.3 & 2.3</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Harvest/add records from IR or local collections</li>
							<li>Are search results relevant</li>
							<li>Include Open Access content to Summon?</li>
							<li>Localized recommendations, research guides, and live reference help to improve UX</li>
							<li>Extend to have social networking tools (reviews, rating, and sharing reading list)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<aside class="notes">Now let's think about metadata. It supports Objective 2.1 & 1.3. This is nothing new. As information professionals, we all know the importance of metadata in our work. Here is a quote from NISO ... We have encountered numerous issues and challenges due to interoperability problem among disparate systems. Accurate and consistent metadata is the key to improve reliability and discoverability of our resources from now and to the future. Semantic Web and Linked Data is the future of our information society. Closely monitor Linked data in libraries will be another important task relates to metadata and cataloging area.</aside>
						<h3>Action 3 -- Metadata Quality Assessment & Control</h3>
						<blockquote>"Metadata is key to ensuring that resources will survive and continue to be accessible into the future." <br><small>(NISO, 2012, p. 1)</small></blockquote>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1 & 1.3</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Interoperability issue prevents us from discovering and sharing resources</li>
							<li>Accuracy and consistency is the key to improve reliability and discoverability of our resources</li>
							<li>Closely monitor Linked data / Semantic Web movement (RDA/BIBFRAME)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section> <!-- slide -->
						<h3>Action 4 -- Mobilizing the library</h3>
						<aside class="notes">Now let's talk about mobilizing the library. It supports Objective 2.1 & 2.3.  I consider this is a challenged area but in a healthy way. Based on my web development experience, this can be as simple as to make the website responsive or adaptive to fit different device screens. But it can also be a very complicated and huge project. Nowadays mobile friendly solution is a must. It means our users can access library resources / services from any devices. It has numerous benefits to library...just to name a few. But the most important thing is: what is our mobile strategy? Should we go mobile web or native mobile app? Each has its own pros and cons. No matter what we will decide, a truly mobile friendly solution should have User Experience and content optimized to mobile devices. This work also requires intensive and ongoing collaboration with campus IT. Curiously I did a simple test on Sheridan library page on my android phone last weekend. Here are some results I’d like to share …</aside>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1 & 2.3</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Access library resources & services from any devices
								<ul>
									<li>Better user experience, increased circulation and student engagement</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>What is our mobile strategy?
								<ul>
									<li>Mobile/Responsive Website vs. Mobile App</li>
									<li>Optimized User Experience/Content/Page Speed/SEO</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Intensive and ongoing collaboration with campus IT</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Action 4 -- Mobilizing the library</h3>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1 & 2.3</p>
						<p>Simple test on Sheridan Library Web page</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Responsive but the library link is pushed down to the bottom on the Sheridan Home page (hard to locate) </li>
							<li>The ‘Search’ icon on top right corner is not for searching library resources(confusing)</li>
							<li>Scroll down to find the ‘Summon’ link, touch to see the search box, then type keywords to search (too many steps required)</li>
							<li>The search results is displayed around 25 seconds</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Action 5 -- Embed library resources and services in LMS</h3>
							<aside class="notes">Last but not least, let’s talk about LMS. It supports Objective 2.1 & 2.2. Usually library resources like articles, books, and web resources are added or embedded to course pages in LMS. We also can create a module...to be included into other courses. or even create a optional, self-paced online course, you know, a little bit like MOOC. I want to do more research on OPAC, Summon APIs and LMS currently used in the library, to identify any gaps or opportunities to integrate them together, and to integrate with eResearves system for more resources and services like scanning book chapters or articles, copyright assistance and alert etc. in LMS. Since we need work on 3 or more systems, the authentication will be a big challenge. It also requires collaborative work among the library team, CTL and campus IT.</aside>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1 & 2.2</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A module for library instructional resources and services, or a MOOC like course</li>
							<li>More research on OPAC, Summon APIs and LMS</li>
							<li>Integrate Course Reserves/eReserves system for more resources</li>
							<li>Challenge on Authentication</li>
							<li>Collaborative work among whole library team, CTL and campus IT</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Recap</h2>
					<aside class="notes">So just to briefly recap here: I used a simple framework to walk you through my approach to draft some work actions which may help us to achieve library's strategic goals. By answering the first question “Where are we going” I could set up 4 core work objectives, with the helps of the other two questions, I proposed 5 work actions I could take to support one or more of those objectives. I am confident that my skills and experiences are a great match for this position and will help the library to achieve those strategic goals with this work plan.</aside>

					<h2>Curious, Purposeful, Smart, Gutsy, Inspired & Real</h2>
					<aside class="notes">From years I have read different strategic plans, but the plans from Sheridan and the Library do give me different experience this time. They are very short and concise with specific goals, full of inspirations and innovations. Sheridan has chosen those 6 keywords to describe its brand. I am really touched by the last word ‘real’. The work plan may not be well-thought-out and need flesh out with more details. It may not fit into the real situation here. but here comes the real part: Based on those strategic plans and the research I did on Sheridan, I strongly believe: this is the kind of place and the kind of people I want to invest my time in. I don't want to be just a 'valuable' resource to the team, I want to be 'invaluable' member of the invaluable team. Together we can deliver high-quality services to our community. Let's not just accept 'good enough' anymore,. Let's be 'excellent’ on providing a premier learning environment. That is all about today's presentation. Thank you all for your time. If anyone has any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.</aside>
