					<aside class="notes">No matter what frameworks we choose for problem-solving or project planning, they all tend to answer these questions.</aside>
					
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Where are we going?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Let's first find out where we are going and what roles the Metadata and Systems Librarian need play for the success of Sheridan's and the Library's strategic plan.</aside>
					<section>
						<h3>Strategic Objectives & Responsibilities Analysis</h3>
					</section>

						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Findings</h3>
						<aside class="notes">All these goals are critical to the success of the library. But from the mapping, we clearly see the super hot goal for the position is Goal 2.1. Followed by Goal 2.3. The findings will provide me a basis of forming work objectives, prioritizing and aligning the work actions with business strategies.</aside>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment highlight-red">Objective 2.1 - Utilize digital tools to provide better access to collections and services</li>
							<li class="fragment">Objective 2.3 - Implement mobile-friendly solutions</li>
							<li class="fragment">Objective 1.3 - Enhance access to external collections</li>
							<li class="fragment">Objective 2.2 - Embed Library content and services into the Learning Management System (LMS)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section> <!-- slide -->
					<h2>Where am I now?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Meanwhile I need know where I am now. Am I ready for this position? Let's find out by mapping main skills and knowledge that I have built up from years in IT field and library environment to the responsibilities of the position required.</aside>
					<section>
						<h3>Core competencies & Responsibilities Analysis</h3>

						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>


				<section> <!-- slide -->
					<h2>Where are we Now?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Great! With those mappings I know what my major work objectives are. More analysis should be done in order to know where we are now, identify existing gaps and explore ways to fill them. Like SWOT analysis. </aside>
					<section>
						<h3>SWOT analysis</h3>
						<p>Identify <span style="color:#CC4B16;">S</span>trengths, <span style="color:#CC4B16;">W</span>eaknesses, <span style="color:#CC4B16;">O</span>pportunities and <span style="color:#CC4B16;">T</span>hreats</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Library Systems/Services Assessment</h3>
						<p>Supports: All strategic objectives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A long-time, multi-dimensional, ongoing and iterative process</li>
							<li>Start from gathering data (Reports and data by Library team, IT & other units on campus)</li>
							<li>Library systems (Website, ILS, Discovery, IR & other technologies)</li>
							<li>User Research to understand user behaviors, needs and motivations</li>
							<li>Service quality assessment</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section> <!-- slide -->
					<h2>How will we get there?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">OK it is time to think about how we get there? Frankly speaking, it will actually largely depend on what I will get from Library Systems/Services Assessment. Now I will try to outline several ideas that could potentially be on my real work plan to support one or more strategic Objectives.</aside>
					<section>
						<aside class="notes">First is to enhance web scale discovery. Are all our IR My Account or local collections included in Summon? Are there information silos? Evaluate our search results, like how relevant? Too many search results? what to show and what to suppress will be tough decision. Do we need include Open Access content like in Digital Commons? This will need work with other staff and faculty members. Can we use "Automated Contextual Research Assistance" through localized recommendations, research guides, and live reference help to improve UX? Do we need or is it possible to have social networking tools, like reviews, rating and sharing, features available in LibraryThing or BiblioCommons?</aside>
						<h3>Enhance Web Scale Discovery</h3>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1, 1.3 & 2.3</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Harvest/add records from IR or local collections</li>
							<li>How relevant are search results?</li>
							<li>Include Open Access content to Summon?</li>
							<li>Automated Contextual Research Assistance</li>
							<li>Extend to have social networking tools (reviews, rating, and reading list)?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<aside class="notes">This is nothing new. As information professionals, we all know the importance of metedata in our work. Here is a quote from a NISO paper... We have encountered numerous issues and challenges due to interoperability problem among disparate systems. Accurate and consistent metadata is the key to improve reliability and discoverability of our resources from now and into the future. Closely monitor Linked data in libraries will be another important task relates to metedata and cataloging.</aside>
						<h3>Metadata Quality Assessment & Control</h3>
						<blockquote>"Metadata is key to ensuring that resources will survive and continue to be accessible into the future." <br><small>(NISO, 2012, p. 1)</small></blockquote>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1 & 1.3</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Interoperability issue prevents us from discovering and sharing resources</li>
							<li>Accuracy and consistency is the key to improve reliability and discoverability of our resources</li>
							<li>Closely monitor Linked data / Semantic Web movement (RDA/BIBFRAME)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h3>Mobilizing the library</h3>
						<aside class="notes">I consider this is a challenged area in a healthy way. Based on my web development work experience, this can be as simple as to make the website responsive or adaptive to fit different device screens. But it can also be a complicated and huge project. Mobile friendly solution is a must. It means our users can access library resources / services from any devices. So what is our mobile strategy? Should we go mobile web or native web app? Each has its own pros and cons. I did a simple test on Sheridan website to access the library page on my android phone. Here are some results: 1)Website is responsive but the library link is pushed down to the bottom, hard to locate 2)the ‘Search’ icon on top right corner is not for searching library resources</aside>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1 & 2.3</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Access library resources & services from any devices
								<ul>
									<li>Better user experience, increase circulation and student engagement</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>What is our mobile strategy?
								<ul>
									<li>Mobile/Responsive Website vs. Mobile App</li>
									<li>Optimized User Experience/Content/Page Speed/SEO</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Intensive and ongoing collaboration with campus IT</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Mobilizing the library</h3>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1 & 2.3</p>
						<p>Simple test on Sheridan Library Web page</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Web page is responsive but the library link is pushed down to the bottom(hard to locate) </li>
							<li>The ‘Search’ icon on top right corner is not for searching library resources(confusing)</li>
							<li>Scroll down to find the ‘Summon’ link, touch once, see the search box, then type keywords to search (too many steps)</li>
							<li>The search results is displayed around 25 seconds</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Embed library resources and services in LMS</h3>
						<aside class="notes">Usually library resources like articles, books, and web resources are added to courses. Can we create a module or course for library instructional resources or services? Optional and self-paced, Like MOOC? How to seamlessly integrate LMS and E-Reserves system. Integrate with eResearves system for more resources like scanning books or articles, copyright assistance and alert etc.</aside>
						<p>Supports: Objective 2.1 & 2.2</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Need more research on OPAC, Summon APIs and LMS in use</li>
							<li>A module/course for library instructional resources and services?</li>
							<li>Integrate Course Reserves/eReserves system for more resources</li>
							<li>Challenge on Authentication</li>
							<li>Collaboration with librarians, copyright staff, and campus IT</li>
